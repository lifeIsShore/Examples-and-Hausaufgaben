     (The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers (the Fibonacci numbers) that starts with a zero, followed
      by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers.
     The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.
     (0,1,1,2,3,5,â€¦..))
        Fibonacci formula: n = (n-1) + (n-2)
        0	1	1	2	3	5	8
        0+1=1
                1+1=2
        1+2=3
        2+3=5
